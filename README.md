# spacetime-curvature-simulator
A real-time C++ and OpenGL simulation exploring how mass curves spacetime, using Newtonian gravity as an approximation of general relativistic curvature. This project visualizes gravitational wells, grid distortion, and motion of celestial bodies in 3D, inspired by Einstein’s field equations.
